To approach the problem, we began by attempting to
filter out all the specific cases of combinations of
letters which is in turn a syllable.
Knowing that, the syllable count in a word is the number
of un-silent vowels, we attempted to filter out the cases
where a vowel is present but silent. Such as double vowels
in "bee" or "see". Josh and Dimitar mainly worked on this approach.
However, Uzzie and Chen worked on a different approach, using the cmu phonems
dictionary to translate the word into phonems, then counting the
number of active vowels in the phonems, this works for all
words which is included in the english dictionary.
Our final approach is a hybrid, where when a word is not found in the
english dictionary we will fall back to our rules approach.
